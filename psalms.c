  didst work in Egypt land,\n     Our fathers, though they saw, yet them\n     they did not understand:\n     \n     And they thy mercies’ multitude\n     kept not in memory;\n     But at the sea,

  he did his people save;\n     And from the en’my’s cruel hand\n     to them redemption gave.\n     \n11   The waters overwhelmed their foes;\n     not one was left alive.\n12   Then they believed his word, and praise\n     to him in songs did give.\n     \n13   But soon did they his mighty works\n     forget unthankfully,\n     And on his counsel and his will\n     did not wait patiently;\n     \n14   But much did lust in wilderness,\n     and God in desert tempt.\n15   He gave them what they sought, but to\n     their soul he leanness sent.\n     \n16   And against Moses in the camp\n     their envy did appear;\n     At Aaron they, the saint of God,\n     envious also were.\n     \n17   Therefore the earth did open wide,\n     and Dathan did devour,\n     And all Abiram’s company\n     did cover in that hour.\n     \n18   Likewise among their company\n     a fire was kindled then;\n     And so the hot consuming flame\n     burnt up these wicked men.\n     \n19   Upon the hill of

Egypt seen.\n     \n22   In Ham’s land he did wondrous works,\n     things terrible did he,\n     When he his mighty hand and arm\n     stretched out at the Red sea.\n     \n23   Then said he, He would them destroy,\n     had not, his wrath to stay,\n     His chosen Moses stood in breach,\n     that them he should not slay.\n     \n24   Yea, they despised the pleasant land,\n     believed not his word:\n25   But in their tents they murmured,\n     not heark’ning to the Lord.\n     \n26   Therefore in desert them to slay\n     he lifted up his hand:\n27   ‘Mong nations to o’erthrow their seed,\n     and scatter in each land.\n     \n28   They unto Baal-peor did\n     themselves associate;\n     The sacrifices of the dead\n     they did profanely eat.\n     \n29   Thus, by their lewd inventions,\n     they did provoke his ire;\n     And then upon them suddenly\n     the plague brake in as fire.\n     \n30   Then Phin’has rose, and justice did,\n     and so the plague did cease;\n31   That to all ages counted was\n     to him for righteousness.\n     \n32   And at the waters, where they strove,\n     they did him angry make,\n     In such sort, that it fared ill\n     with Moses for their sake:\n     \n33   Because they there his spirit meek\n     provoked bitterly,\n     So that he uttered with his lips\n     words unadvisedly.\n     \n34   Nor, as the Lord commanded them,\n     did they the nations slay:\n35   But with the heathen mingled were,\n     and learned of them their way.\n     \n36   And they their idols served, which did\n     a snare unto them turn.\n37   Their sons and daughters they to dev’ls\n     in sacrifice did burn.\n     \n38   In their own children’s guiltless blood\n     their hands they did imbrue,\n     Whom to Canaan’s idols they\n     for sacrifices slew:\n     \n     So was the land defiled with blood.\n39   They stained with their own way,\n     And with their own inventions\n     a whoring they did stray.\n     \n40   Against his people kindled was\n     the wrath of God therefore,\n     Insomuch that he did his own\n     inheritance abhor.\n     \n41   He gave them to the heathen’s hand;\n     their foes did them command.\n42   Their en’mies them oppressed, they were\n     made subject to their hand.\n     \n43   He many times delivered them;\n     but with their counsel so\n     They him provoked, that for their sin\n     they were brought very low.\n     \n44   Yet their affliction he beheld,\n     when he did hear their cry:\n45   And he for them his covenant\n     did call to memory;\n     \n     After his mercies’ multitude\n46   he did repent: And made\n     Them to be pitied of all those\n     who did them captive lead.\n     \n47   O Lord our God, us save, and gather\n     the heathen from among,\n     That we thy holy name may praise\n     in a triumphant song.\n     \n48   Blessed be Jehovah, Isr’el’s God,\n     to all eternity:\n     Let all the people say, Amen.\n

uphold and stablish me,\n     That I may live, and of my hope\n     ashamed never be.\n     \n117  Hold thou me up, so shall I be\n     in peace and safety still;\n     And to thy statutes have respect\n     continually I will.\n     \n118  Thou tread’st down all that love to stray;\n     false their deceit doth prove.\n119  Lewd men, like dross, away thou putt’st;\n     therefore thy law I love.\n     \n120  For fear of thee my very flesh\n     doth tremble, all dismayed;\n     And of thy righteous judgments, Lord,\n     my soul is much afraid.\n\nAin, The 16th Part.\n121  To all men I

therefore;\n     And ev’ry false and wicked way\n     I perfectly abhor.\n\nPe, The 17th Part.\n129  Thy statutes, Lord, are wonderful,\n     my soul them keeps with care.\n130  The entrance of thy

Look on me, Lord, and merciful\n     do thou unto me prove,\n     As thou art wont to do to those\n     thy name who truly love.\n     \n133  O let my footsteps in thy word\n     aright still ordered be:\n     Let no iniquity obtain\n     dominion over me.\n     \n134  From man’s oppression save thou me;\n     so keep thy laws I will.\n135  Thy face make on thy servant shine;\n     teach me thy statutes still.\n     \n136  Rivers of waters from mine eyes\n     did run down, when I saw\n     How wicked men run on in sin,\n     and do not keep thy law.\n\nTzaddi, The 18th Part.\n137  O Lord, thou art most righteous;\n     thy judgments are upright.\n138  Thy testimonies thou command’st\n     most faithful are and right.\n     \n139  My zeal hath ev’n consumed me,\n     because mine enemies\n     Thy holy words forgotten have,\n     and do thy laws despise.\n     \n140  Thy word’s most pure, therefore on it\n     thy servant’s love is set.\n141  Small, and despised I am, yet I\n     thy precepts not forget.\n     \n142  Thy righteousness is righteousness\n     which ever doth endure:\n     Thy holy law, Lord, also is\n     the very truth most pure.\n     \n143  Trouble and anguish have me found,\n     and taken hold on me:\n     Yet in my trouble my delight\n     thy just commandements be.\n     \n144  Eternal righteousness is in\n     thy testimonies all:\n     Lord, to me understanding give,\n     and ever live I shall.\n\nKoph, The 19th Part.\n145  With my whole heart I cried, Lord, hear;\n     I will thy word obey.\n146  I cried to thee; save me, and I\n     will keep thy laws alway.\n     \n147  I of the morning did prevent\n     the dawning, and did cry:\n     For all mine expectation\n     did on thy word rely.\n     \n148  Mine eyes did timeously prevent\n     the watches of the night,\n     That in thy word with careful mind\n     then meditate I might.\n     \n149  After thy loving-kindness hear\n     my voice, that calls on thee:\n

thy commandements are.\n     \n152  As for thy testimonies all,\n     of old this have I tried,\n     That thou hast surely founded them\n     for ever to abide.\n\nResh, The 20th Part.\n153  Consider mine affliction,\n     in safety do me set:\n     Deliver me, O Lord, for I\n     thy law do not forget.\n     \n154  After thy word revive thou me:\n     save me, and plead my cause.\n155  Salvation is from sinners far;\n     for they seek not thy laws.\n     \n156  O Lord, both great and manifold\n     thy tender mercies be:\n     According to thy judgments just,\n     revive and quicken me.\n     \n157  My persecutors many are,\n     and foes that do combine;\n     Yet from thy testimonies pure\n     my heart doth not decline.\n     \n158  I saw transgressors, and was grieved;\n     for they keep not thy word.\n159  See how I love thy law! as thou\n     art kind, me quicken, Lord.\n     \n160  From the beginning all thy word\n     hath been most true and sure:\n     Thy righteous judgments ev’ry one\n     for evermore endure.\n\nSchin, The 21st Part.\n161  Princes have persecuted me,\n     although no cause they saw:\n     But still of thy most holy word\n     my heart doth stand in awe.\n     \n162  I at thy word rejoice, as one\n     of spoil that finds great store.\n163  Thy law I love; but lying all\n     I hate and do abhor.\n     \n164  Sev’n times a-day it is my

none.\n166  I hoped for thy salvation, Lord,\n     and thy commands have done.\n     \n167  My soul thy testimonies pure\n     observed carefully;\n     On them my heart is set, and them\n     I love exceedingly.\n     \n168  Thy testimonies and thy laws\n     I kept with special care;\n     For all my works and ways each one\n     before thee open are.\n\nTau, The 22nd Part.\n169  O let my

free.\n171  My lips shall utter praise, when thou\n     hast taught thy laws to me.\n     \n172  My tongue of thy most blessed word\n     shall speak, and it confess;\n     Because all thy commandements\n     are perfect righteousness.\n     \n173  Let thy strong hand make help to me:\n     thy precepts are my choice.\n174  I longed for thy salvation, Lord,\n     and in thy law rejoice.\n     \n175  O let my soul live, and it shall\n     give praises unto thee;\n     And let thy judgments gracious\n     be helpful unto me.\n     \n176  I, like a lost sheep, went astray;\n
