    // Psalm 1
    "1   That man hath perfect blessedness,\n    who walketh not astray\n    In counsel of ungodly men,\n    nor stands in sinners’ way,\n\n    Nor sitteth in the scorner’s chair:\n2   But placeth his delight\n    Upon God’s law, and meditates\n    on his law day and night.\n\n3   He shall be like a tree that grows\n    near planted by a river,\n    Which in his season yields his fruit,\n    and his leaf fadeth never:\n\n    And all he doth shall prosper well\n4   The wicked are not so;\n    But like they are unto the chaff,\n    which wind drives to and fro.\n\n5   In judgment therefore shall not stand\n    such as ungodly are;\n    Nor in th’ assembly of the just\n    shall wicked men appear.\n\n6   For why? the way of godly men\n    unto the Lord is known:\n    Whereas the way of wicked men\n    shall quite be overthrown.",
    // Psalm 2
    "1   Why rage the heathen? and vain things\n    why do the people mind?\n2   Kings of the earth do set themselves,\n    and princes are combin’d,\n\n    To plot against the Lord, and his\n    Anointed, saying thus,\n3   Let us asunder break their bands,\n    and cast their cords from us.\n\n4   He that in heaven sits shall laugh;\n    the Lord shall scorn them all.\n5   Then shall he speak to them in wrath,\n    in rage he vex them shall.\n\n6   Yet, notwithstanding, I have him\n    to be my King appointed;\n    And over Sion, my holy hill,\n    I have him King anointed.\n\n7   The sure decree I will declare:\n    The Lord hath said to me,\n    Thou art mine only Son; this day\n    I have begotten thee.\n\n8   Ask of me, and for heritage\n    the heathen I’ll make thine;\n    And, for possession, I to thee\n    will give earth’s utmost line.\n\n9   Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod\n    of iron, break them all;\n    And, as a potter’s sherd, thou shalt\n    them dash in pieces small.\n\n10  Now therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,\n    ye judges of the earth:\n11  Serve God in fear, and see that ye\n    join trembling with your mirth.\n\n12  Kiss ye the Son, lest in his ire\n    ye perish from the way,\n    If once his wrath begin to burn:\n    bless’d all that on him stay.",
    // Psalm 3
    "1   O Lord, how are my foes increas’d?\n    against me many rise.\n2   Many say of my soul, For him\n    in God no succour lies.\n\n3   Yet thou my shield and glory art,\n    th’ uplifter of mine head.\n4   I cry’d, and, from his holy hill,\n    the Lord me answer made.\n\n5   I laid me down and slept; I wak’d;\n    for God sustained me.\n6   I will not fear though thousands ten\n    set round against me be.\n\n7   Arise, O Lord; save me, my God;\n    for thou my foes hast stroke\n    All on the cheek-bone, and the teeth\n    of wicked men hast broke.\n\n8   Salvation doth appertain\n    unto the Lord alone:\n    Thy blessing, Lord, for evermore\n    thy people is upon.",
    // Psalm 4
    "1   Give ear unto me when I call,\n    God of my righteousness:\n    Have mercy, hear my pray’r; thou hast\n    enlarg’d me in distress.\n\n2   O ye the sons of men! how long\n    will ye love vanities?\n    How long my glory turn to shame,\n    and will ye follow lies?\n\n3   But know, that for himself the Lord\n    the godly man doth chuse:\n    The Lord, when I on him do call,\n    to hear will not refuse.\n\n4   Fear, and sin not; talk with your heart\n    on bed, and silent be.\n5   Off ‘rings present of righteousness,\n    and in the Lord trust ye.\n\n6   O who will shew us any good?\n    is that which many say:\n    But of thy countenance the light,\n    Lord, lift on us alway.\n\n7   Upon my heart, bestow’d by thee,\n    more gladness I have found\n    Than they, ev’n then, when corn and wine\n    did most with them abound.\n\n8   I will both lay me down in peace,\n    and quiet sleep will take;\n    Because thou only me to dwell\n    in safety, Lord, dost make.",
    // Psalm 5
    "1   Give ear unto my words, O Lord,\n    my meditation weigh.\n2   Hear my loud cry, my King, my God;\n    for I to thee will pray.\n\n3   Lord, thou shalt early hear my voice:\n    I early will direct\n    My pray’r to thee; and, looking up,\n    an answer will expect.\n\n4   For thou art not a God that doth\n    in wickedness delight;\n    Neither shall evil dwell with thee,\n5   Nor fools stand in thy sight.\n\n    All that ill-doers are thou hat’st;\n6   Cutt’st off that liars be:\n    The bloody and deceitful man\n    abhorred is by thee.\n\n7   But I into thy house will come\n    in thine abundant grace;\n    And I will worship in thy fear\n    toward thy holy place.\n\n8   Because of those mine enemies,\n    Lord, in thy righteousness\n    Do thou me lead; do thou thy way\n    make straight before my face.\n\n9   For in their mouth there is no truth,\n    their inward part is ill;\n    Their throat’s an open sepulchre,\n    their tongue doth flatter still.\n\n10  O God, destroy them; let them be\n    by their own counsel quell’d:\n    Them for their many sins cast out,\n    for they ‘gainst thee rebell’d.\n\n11  But let all joy that trust in thee,\n    and still make shouting noise;\n    For them thou sav’st; let all that love\n    thy name in thee rejoice.\n\n12  For, Lord, unto the righteous man\n    thou wilt thy blessing yield:\n    With favour thou wilt compass him\n    about, as with a shield.",
    // Psalm 6
    "1   Lord, in thy wrath rebuke me not;\n    Nor in thy hot rage chasten me.\n2   Lord, pity me, for I am weak:\n    Heal me, for my bones vexed be.\n\n3   My soul is also vexed sore;\n    But, Lord, how long stay wilt thou make?\n4   Return, O Lord, my soul set free;\n    O save me, for thy mercies’ sake.\n\n5   Because those that deceased are\n    Of thee shall no remembrance have;\n    And who is he that will to thee\n    Give praises lying in the grave?\n\n6   I with my groaning weary am,\n    I also all the night my bed\n    Have caused for to swim; and I\n    With tears my couch have watered.\n\n7   Mine eye, consum’d with grief, grows old,\n    Because of all mine enemies.\n8   Hence from me, wicked workers all;\n    For God hath heard my weeping cries.\n\n9   God hath my supplication heard,\n    My pray’r received graciously\n10  Sham’d and sore vex’d be all my foes,\n    Sham’d and back turned suddenly.",
