    "[1] That man hath perfect blessedness,\nwho walketh not astray\nIn "
    "counsel of ungodly men,\nnor stands in sinners’ way,\n\nNor sitteth "
    "in the scorner’s chair:\n[2] But placeth his delight\nUpon God’s law, "
    "and meditates\non his law day and night.\n\n[3] He shall be like a "
    "tree that grows\nnear planted by a river,\nWhich in his season yields "
    "his fruit,\nand his leaf fadeth never:\n\nAnd all he doth shall "
    "prosper well\n[4] The wicked are not so;\nBut like they are unto the "
    "chaff,\nwhich wind drives to and fro.\n\n[5] In judgment therefore "
    "shall not stand\nsuch as ungodly are;\nNor in th’ assembly of the "
    "just\nshall wicked men appear.\n\n[6] For why? the way of godly "
    "men\nunto the Lord is known:\nWhereas the way of wicked men\nshall "
    "quite be overthrown.",
    // Psalm 2
    "[1] Why rage the heathen? and vain things\nwhy do the people "
    "mind?\n[2] Kings of the earth do set themselves,\nand princes are "
    "combin’d,\n\nTo plot against the Lord, and his\nAnointed, saying "
    "thus,\n[3] Let us asunder break their bands,\nand cast their cords "
    "from us.\n\n[4] He that in heaven sits shall laugh;\nthe Lord shall "
    "scorn them all.\n[5] Then shall he speak to them in wrath,\nin rage "
    "he vex them shall.\n\n[6] Yet, notwithstanding, I have him\nto be my "
    "King appointed;\nAnd over Sion, my holy hill,\nI have him King "
    "anointed.\n\n[7] The sure decree I will declare:\nThe Lord hath said "
    "to me,\nThou art mine only Son; this day\nI have begotten "
    "thee.\n\n[8] Ask of me, and for heritage\nthe heathen I’ll make "
    "thine;\nAnd, for possession, I to thee\nwill give earth’s utmost "
    "line.\n\n[9] Thou shalt, as with a weighty rod\nof iron, break them "
    "all;\nAnd, as a potter’s sherd, thou shalt\nthem dash in pieces "
    "small.\n\n[10] Now therefore, kings, be wise; be taught,\nye judges "
    "of the earth:\n[11] Serve God in fear, and see that ye\njoin "
    "trembling with your mirth.\n\n[12] Kiss ye the Son, lest in his "
    "ire\nye perish from the way,\nIf once his wrath begin to "

    "[1] O Lord, how are my foes increas’d?\nagainst me many rise.\n[2] "
    "Many say of my soul, For him\nin God no succour lies.\n\n[3] Yet thou "
    "my shield and glory art,\nth’ uplifter of mine head.\n[4] I cry’d, "

    "down and slept; I wak’d;\nfor God sustained me.\n[6] I will not fear "
    "though thousands ten\nset round against me be.\n\n[7] Arise, O Lord; "
    "save me, my God;\nfor thou my foes hast stroke\nAll on the "
    "cheek-bone, and the teeth\nof wicked men hast broke.\n\n[8] Salvation "
    "doth appertain\nunto the Lord alone:\nThy blessing, Lord, for "

    "[1] Give ear unto me when I call,\nGod of my righteousness:\nHave "

    "glory turn to shame,\nand will ye follow lies?\n\n[3] But know, that "
    "for himself the Lord\nthe godly man doth chuse:\nThe Lord, when I on "
    "him do call,\nto hear will not refuse.\n\n[4] Fear, and sin not; talk "
    "with your heart\non bed, and silent be.\n[5] Off ‘rings present of "

    "any good?\nis that which many say:\nBut of thy countenance the "
    "light,\nLord, lift on us alway.\n\n[7] Upon my heart, bestow’d by "
    "thee,\nmore gladness I have found\nThan they, ev’n then, when corn "

    "thou shalt early hear my voice:\nI early will direct\nMy pray’r to "
    "thee; and, looking up,\nan answer will expect.\n\n[4] For thou art "

    "with thee,\n[5] Nor fools stand in thy sight.\n\nAll that ill-doers "
    "are thou hat’st;\n[6] Cutt’st off that liars be:\nThe bloody and "

    "fear\ntoward thy holy place.\n\n[8] Because of those mine "
    "enemies,\nLord, in thy righteousness\nDo thou me lead; do thou thy "
    "way\nmake straight before my face.\n\n[9] For in their mouth there is "
    "no truth,\ntheir inward part is ill;\nTheir throat’s an open "
    "sepulchre,\ntheir tongue doth flatter still.\n\n[10] O God, destroy "
    "them; let them be\nby their own counsel quell’d:\nThem for their many "
    "sins cast out,\nfor they ‘gainst thee rebell’d.\n\n[11] But let all "
    "joy that trust in thee,\nand still make shouting noise;\nFor them "
    "thou sav’st; let all that love\nthy name in thee rejoice.\n[12] For, "

    "thou make?\n[4] Return, O Lord, my soul set free;\nO save me, for thy "
    "mercies’ sake.\n\n[5] Because those that deceased are\nOf thee shall "
    "no "
    "remembrance have;\nAnd who is he that will to thee\nGive praises "
    "lying "
    "in the grave?\n\n[6] I with my groaning weary am,\nI also all the "
    "night "
    "my bed\nHave caused for to swim; and I\nWith tears my couch have "
    "watered.\n\n[7] Mine eye, consum’d with grief, grows old,\nBecause of "
    "all mine enemies.\n[8] Hence from me, wicked workers all;\nFor God "

    "thou know’st\nmy bones much vexed are.\n\n[3] My soul is vexed sore: "

    "death there shall\nno more remembrance be:\nOf those that in the "
    "grave "
    "do lie,\nwho shall give thanks to thee?\n\n[6] I with my groaning "
    "weary "
    "am,\nand all the night my bed\nI caused for to swim; with tears\nmy "

    "now, depart from me all ye\nthat work iniquity:\nFor why? the Lord "

    "me;\n(Yea, ev’n the man that without cause\nmy foe was I did "
    "free;)\n\n[5] Then let the foe pursue and take\nmy soul, and my life "
    "thrust\nDown to the earth, and let him lay\nmine honour in the "
    "dust.\n\n[6] Rise in thy wrath, Lord, raise thyself,\nfor my foes "
    "raging be;\nAnd, to the judgment which thou hast\ncommanded, wake for "
    "me.\n\n[7] So shall th’ assembly of thy folk\nabout encompass "
    "thee:\nThou, therefore, for their sakes, return\nunto thy place on "

    "[1] Thee will I love, O Lord, my strength.\n[2] My fortress is the "

    "me went;\n[5] Hell’s sorrows me environed;\ndeath’s snares did me "
    "prevent.\n\n[6] In my distress I call’d on God,\ncry to my God did I;\nHe "
    "from his temple heard my voice,\nto his ears came my cry.\n\n[7] Th’ "
    "earth, as affrighted, then did shake,\ntrembling upon it seiz’d:\nThe "
    "hills’ foundations moved were,\nbecause he was displeas’d.\n\n[8] Up from "
    "his nostrils came a smoke,\nand from his mouth there came\nDevouring "
    "fire, and coals by it\nwere turned into flame.\n\n[9] He also bowed down "
    "the heav’ns,\nand thence he did descend;\nAnd thickest clouds of darkness "
    "did\nunder his feet attend.\n\n[10] And he upon a cherub rode,\nand "
    "thereon he did fly;\nYea, on the swift wings of the wind\nhis flight was "
    "from on high.\n\n[11] He darkness made his secret place:\nabout him, for "
    "his tent,\nDark waters were, and thickest clouds\nof th’ airy "
    "firmament.\n\n[12] And at the brightness of that light,\nwhich was before "
    "his eye,\nHis thick clouds pass’d away, hailstones\nand coals of fire did "
    "fly.\n\n[13] The Lord God also in the heav’ns\ndid thunder in his "
    "ire;\nAnd there the Highest gave his voice,\nhailstones and coals of "
    "fire.\n\n[14] Yea, he his arrows sent abroad,\nand them he "
    "scattered;\nHis lightnings also he shot out,\nand them "
    "discomfited.\n\n[15] The waters’ channels then were seen,\nthe world’s "
    "foundations vast\nAt thy rebuke discover’d were,\nand at thy nostrils’ "
    "blast.\n\n[16] And from above the Lord sent down,\nand took me from "
    "below;\nFrom many waters he me drew,\nwhich would me overflow.\n\n[17] He "
    "me reliev’d from my strong foes,\nand such as did me hate;\nBecause he "
    "saw that they for me\ntoo strong were, and too great.\n\n[18] They me "
    "prevented in the day\nof my calamity;\nBut even then the Lord himself\na "
    "stay was unto me.\n\n[19] He to a place where liberty\nand room was hath "
    "me brought;\nBecause he took delight in me,\nhe my deliv’rance "
    "wrought.\n\n[20] According to my righteousness\nhe did me recompense,\nHe "
    "me repaid according to\nmy hands’ pure innocence.\n\n[21] For I God’s "
    "ways kept, from my God\ndid not turn wickedly.\nHis judgments were before "
    "me, I\nhis laws put not from me.\n\n[23] Sincere before him was my "
    "heart;\nwith him upright was I;\nAnd watchfully I kept myself\nfrom mine "
    "iniquity.\n\n[24] After my righteousness the Lord\nhath recompensed "
    "me,\nAfter the cleanness of my hands\nappearing in his eye.\n\n[25] Thou "
    "gracious to the gracious art,\nto upright men upright:\n[26] Pure to the "
    "pure, froward thou kyth’st\nunto the froward wight.\n\n[27] For thou wilt "
    "the afflicted save\nin grief that low do lie:\nBut wilt bring down the "
    "countenance\nof them whose looks are high.\n\n[28] The Lord will light my "
    "candle so,\nthat it shall shine full bright:\nThe Lord my God will also "
    "make\nmy darkness to be light.\n\n[29] By thee through troops of men I "
    "break,\nand them discomfit all;\nAnd, by my God assisting me,\nI overleap "
    "a wall.\n\n[30] As for God, perfect is his way:\nthe Lord his word is "
    "try’d;\nHe is a buckler to all those\nwho do in him confide.\n\n[31] Who "
    "but the Lord is God? but he\nwho is a rock and stay?\n[32] ‘Tis God that "
    "girdeth me with strength,\nand perfect makes my way.\n\n[33] He made my "
    "feet swift as the hinds,\nset me on my high places.\n[34] Mine hands to "
    "war he taught, mine arms\nbrake bows of steel in pieces.\n\n[35] The "
    "shield of thy salvation\nthou didst on me bestow:\nThy right hand held me "
    "up, and great\nthy kindness made me grow.\n\n[36] And in my way my steps "
    "thou hast\nenlarged under me,\nThat I go safely, and my feet\nare kept "
    "from sliding free.\n\n[37] Mine en’mies I pursued have,\nand did them "
    "overtake;\nNor did I turn again till I\nan end of them did make.\n\n[38] "
    "I wounded them, they could not rise;\nthey at my feet did fall.\n[39] "
    "Thou girdedst me with strength for war;\nmy foes thou brought’st down "
    "all:\n\n[40] And thou hast giv’n to me the necks\nof all mine "
    "enemies;\nThat I might them destroy and slay,\nwho did against me "
    "rise.\n\n[41] They cried out, but there was none\nthat would or could "
    "them save;\nYea, they did cry unto the Lord,\nbut he no answer "
    "gave.\n\n[42] Then did I beat them small as dust\nbefore the wind that "
    "flies;\nAnd I did cast them out like dirt\nupon the street that "
    "lies.\n\n[43] Thou mad’st me free from people’s strife,\nand heathen’s "
    "head to be:\nA people whom I have not known\nshall service do to "
    "me.\n\n[44] At hearing they shall me obey,\nto me they shall "
    "submit.\n[45] Strangers for fear shall fade away,\nwho in close places "
    "sit.\n\n[46] God lives, bless’d be my Rock; the God\nof my health praised "
    "be.\n[47] God doth avenge me, and subdues\nthe people under me.\n\n[48] "
    "He saves me from mine enemies;\nyea, thou hast lifted me\nAbove my foes; "
    "and from the man\nof vi’lence set me free.\n\n[49] Therefore to thee will "
    "I give thanks\nthe heathen folk among;\nAnd to thy name, O Lord, I "
